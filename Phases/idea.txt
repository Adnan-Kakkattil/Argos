This is a comprehensive, step-by-step development plan designed to be handed directly to an AI agent (like a coding assistant) to build Argos (the Overseer).Project Argos: Enterprise Employee Monitoring Implementation PlanCore ObjectiveBuild a multi-tenant enterprise system where a single "Universal MSI" installer (Rust) dynamically configures itself for specific organizations using a Python (FastAPI) backend.Step 1: Backend Infrastructure (Python/FastAPI)The backend handles organizational hierarchy (Tenants > Branches > Companies) and the logic for the dynamic installer.1.1 Multi-Tenant Database Schema:Tenants Table: id, name, admin_api_key.Organizations/Branches Table: id, tenant_id, name.Agents Table: id, org_id, machine_name, hardware_uuid, last_seen.Telemetry Table: agent_id, window_title, timestamp, is_idle, screenshot_url.1.2 Dynamic Download Endpoint:Create a route: GET /dashboard/download/{org_id}.Logic: When called, it fetches the "Master MSI," renames it to Argos_Setup_[org_id].msi, and streams it to the client.1.3 Data Intake API:Create POST /api/v1/heartbeat and POST /api/v1/telemetry.Step 2: The Rust Agent (The "Overseer" Core)The agent is a background worker that tracks activity and takes screenshots.2.1 Bootstrapping (The "Confused" Agent Problem):Implement logic to read std::env::current_exe().Extract the org_id from the filename (e.g., Argos_Setup_[ID].msi).On the first run, the agent pings the backend to "register" itself and receives a permanent Agent Token.2.2 Monitoring Loop:Window Tracking: Use active-win or winapi crates to log the foreground process name and window title every 10–30 seconds.Idle Detection: Use device_query to check for keyboard/mouse movement.Screenshots: Use the screenshots crate to capture the primary monitor at randomized intervals.2.3 Network Persistence:If the internet is down, store telemetry in a local SQLite file.Sync to the Python API when the connection is restored.Step 3: The Universal Installer (WiX Toolset / MSI)Instead of building a new MSI for every client, we use one "Master MSI."3.1 Packaging:Use the WiX Toolset to package the compiled Rust .exe.Configure the MSI to install the agent as a Windows Service so it starts automatically on boot.3.2 The Renaming Logic:Ensure the Rust agent logic checks its own installation path or original filename to find the Organization ID if passed as a property.Step 4: Platform Admin Dashboard (HTML/Tailwind)A simple interface to manage the enterprise structure.4.1 Hierarchy Management:Create views to add new Tenants (e.g., "Global Corp").Add Branches (e.g., "India Office", "US Office").4.2 Live Monitoring View:A dashboard showing "Online" vs "Offline" agents using a simple color-coded table.A gallery view for the latest screenshots associated with a specific Organization ID.Step 5: Integration & Security5.1 Data Encryption: The agent must encrypt screenshot files before uploading.5.2 API Security: All telemetry endpoints must require the Agent Token in the header.5.3 Stealth Mode: Ensure the agent has no tray icon and runs with low CPU priority to remain "invisible" to productivity.Technical Stack Summary for your AI AgentComponentTechnologyRecommended LibrariesBackendPython (FastAPI)fastapi, sqlalchemy, pydantic, uvicornAgentRusttokio (async), reqwest (API), screenshots (image), winapi (windows)DatabasePostgreSQLStandard relational DB for multi-tenant isolationFrontendHTML5 / TailwindUse basic templates for the dashboardInstallerMSIWiX Toolset
